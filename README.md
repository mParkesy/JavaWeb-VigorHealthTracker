# Health Tracker Software Engineering, Vigor Health

The aim of this piece of coursework was to develop a Health Tracker web application in a small group following
normal Software Engieering protocols and the Model View Controller idea.
The website is a Java Web Applicaiton with a MySQL backend.
In some cases the web pages are basic views that interact with simple controller functions, however for some of the pages,
there is a large use of AJAX calls in javascript to make the page more dynamic.

## Getting Started and Installation

The website requires Apache Tomcat as well as a form of MySQL host.
The provided SQL file should be imported into a database using such software as PHPMyAdmin.
